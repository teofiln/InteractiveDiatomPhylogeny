Interactive Diatom Phylogeny

A tool for exploring the phylogeny of diatoms

<p>This Shiny R code is meant as a tool to explore the diatom phylogeny. The main functionality so far is plotting pre-defined sub-trees or sub-trees based on two user-selected terminal nodes. The code depends on the R packages <a href=http://ape-package.ird.fr>ape</a> and <a href=http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html>phangorn</a>. The code is rather clunky, but it does serve its basic purpose.</p> <p>To browse the diatom phylogeny [visit](https://diatom.shinyapps.io/InteractiveDiatomPhylogeny/). Alternatively run the Interactive Diatom Phylogeny use R and call it from its GitHub repository:</p> <p> <code>shiny::runGitHub('InteractiveDiatomPhylogeny', 'teofiln')</code></p> <p>The topology is that of Theriot et al. 2010 (Plant Ecology and Evolution). This will be replaced by a much larger tree constructed from all available diatom nSSU sequences soon.</p> <p>For an excellent treeviewer in Shiny with the functionality to load your own tree see <a href=https://github.com/KlausVigo/shinyTreeViewer/blob/master/ui.R>shinyTreeViewer</a>.</p>
